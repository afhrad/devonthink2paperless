## Steps to load the database into Paperless

### Prepare to export everything

First of all we have to export all data into a readable file structure to prepare the upload.
This is essential because the only way to communicate with Devonthink is AppleScript. So we use Applescript to make an export and save some metadata found in the database.
Thus we can work with more modern programming languages (like Python) to get the work done. Another benefit is, that encrypted documents will become unencrypted in the export.
The AppleScript part has mostly be generated by a coding assistant because nobody wants to learn AppleScript and it gets the work done properly.
So call the `export_devonthink.applescript` via terminal like:

    osascript export_devonthink.applescript "/Users/<user>/document.dtBase2" "/Users/<user>/wheretoexport"

Be sure to use quotation marks an use the extension `.dtBase2`. The database itself does not neet to be open, it will be opened by the applescript.
After a while you get the complete structure of your DevonThink database as a folder structure with each document having a companion file with the extension `.json`.
This file contains all relevant metadata the script found during export. Feel free to add your own in the script.
